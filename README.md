# Regression Analysis Jupyter Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook contains a comprehensive analysis of a dataset related to Bengaluru house prices. The notebook employs regression techniques to understand and predict housing prices based on various features.

## Structure
The notebook is divided into the following sections:

1. **Data Import and Inspection**
   - Import necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib).
   - Load the dataset `Bengaluru_House_Data.csv`.
   - Display dataset information including data types and null values.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values and incorrect data types.
   - Feature engineering to create new relevant features.
   - Encode categorical variables.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize distributions of variables.
   - Analyze relationships between features and the target variable (price).
   - Detect and handle outliers.

4. **Model Building**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor).
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

5. **Model Evaluation and Selection**
   - Compare different models based on performance metrics.
   - Select the best model for predicting house prices.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
4. Follow the sections step-by-step to reproduce the analysis.
